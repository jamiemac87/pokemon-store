# PokemonStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing we need to make sure your environment is set up correctly.

### Install Node

Make sure you have node installed. Versions 8.x or 10.x are required.
You may already have node installed. You can check by opening your terminal and
running `node -v`.

If you do not have node installed you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Install Yarn

yarn is a package manager similar to node package manager (npm) and is the preferred package
manager for this project. Install it by running `brew install yarn`.

### Install Angular CLI

Next we need to install the angular cli in order to build and run our project. Open up your terminal
and run the following command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Further documentation on the cli can be found [here](https://angular.io/cli).

### Install Postman

Postman can be downloaded [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/). You can find the postman collections and environments within the postman folder of this repo.

## Install project dependencies

Run `yarn` to install all the projects dependencies.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
